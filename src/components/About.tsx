            I am a full-stack developer based in Cairo, looking for exciting
            opportunities. Has Mobile Development and ML background. Likes to
            focus on accessibility when developing. Passionate and curious
            about solving problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Nextjs, Typescript, Python
            and a bit of Designing. While I am not a programmer, I enjoy drawing, photography, and cooking. 
            Learning more to improve my skill.
